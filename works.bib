  title     = "Scientific Item Recommendation Using a Citation Network",
  abstract  = "Scientific items (such as papers or datasets) discovery and reuse is crucial to support and improve scientific research. However, the process is often tortuous, and researchers end up using less than ideal datasets. Search engines tailored to this task are useful, but current systems only support keyword searches. This hinders the process, because the user needs to imagine what kind of keywords would give useful datasets. In this paper, we investigate a new technique to recommend scientific items (paper or datasets). This technique uses a graph consisting of scientific papers, the corresponding citation network, and datasets used in these works as background information for its recommendation. Specifically, a link-predictor is trained which is then used to infer useful datasets for the paper the researcher is working on. As an input, it uses the co-author information, citation information, and the already used datasets. To compare different scientific items recommendation approaches fairly and to prove their efficiency, we created a new benchmark. This benchmark includes more than three million scientific items to evaluate the performance of recommendation approaches. We experiment with a variety of methods and find that an ensemble technique which uses link prediction on the citation network yields a precision of nearly 70%.",

  abstract = "Gut microbiota produce and modulate the production of neurotransmitters which have been implicated in mental disorders. Neurotransmitters may act as {\textquoteleft}matchmaker{\textquoteright} between gut microbiota imbalance and mental disorders. Most of the relevant research effort goes into the relationship between gut microbiota and neurotransmitters and the other between neurotransmitters and mental disorders, while few studies collect and analyze the dispersed research results in systematic ways. We therefore gather the dispersed results that in the existing studies into a structured knowledge base for identifying and predicting the potential relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders. In this study, we propose to construct a gut microbiota knowledge graph for mental disorder, which named as MiKG4MD. It is extendable by linking to future ontologies by just adding new relationships between existing information and new entities. This extendibility is emphasized for the integration with existing popular ontologies/terminologies, e.g. UMLS, MeSH, and KEGG. We demonstrate the performance of MiKG4MD with three SPARQL query test cases. Results show that the MiKG4MD knowledge graph is an effective method to predict the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders.",

  title     = "Software defect prediction based on non-linear manifold learning and hybrid deep learning techniques",
  abstract  = "Software defect prediction plays a very important role in software quality assurance, which aims to inspect as many potentially defect-prone software modules as possible. However, the performance of the prediction model is susceptible to high dimensionality of the dataset that contains irrelevant and redundant features. In addition, software metrics for software defect prediction are almost entirely traditional features compared to the deep semantic feature representation from deep learning techniques. To address these two issues, we propose the following two solutions in this paper: (1) We leverage a novel non-linear manifold learning method - SOINN Landmark Isomap (SL-Isomap) to extract the representative features by selecting automatically the reasonable number and position of landmarks, which can reveal the complex intrinsic structure hidden behind the defect data. (2) We propose a novel defect prediction model named DLDD based on hybrid deep learning techniques, which leverages denoising autoencoder to learn true input features that are not contaminated by noise, and utilizes deep neural network to learn the abstract deep semantic features. We combine the squared error loss function of denoising autoencoder with the cross entropy loss function of deep neural network to achieve the best prediction performance by adjusting a hyperparameter. We compare the SL-Isomap with seven state-of-the-art feature extraction methods and compare the DLDD model with six baseline models across 20 open source software projects. The experimental results verify that the superiority of SL-Isomap and DLDD on four evaluation indicators.",

  abstract  = "Software defect prediction plays an important role in software quality assurance. However, the performance of the prediction model is susceptible to the irrelevant and redundant features. In addition, previous studies mostly regard software defect prediction as a single objective optimization problem, and multi-objective software defect prediction has not been thoroughly investigated. For the above two reasons, we propose the following solutions in this paper: (1) we leverage an advanced deep neural network-Stacked Contractive AutoEncoder (SCAE) to extract the robust deep semantic features from the original defect features, which has stronger discrimination capacity for different classes (defective or non-defective). (2) we propose a novel multi-objective defect prediction model named SMONGE that utilizes the Multi-Objective NSGAII algorithm to optimize the advanced neural network-Extreme learning machine (ELM) based on state-of-the-art Pareto optimal solutions according to the features extracted by SCAE. We mainly consider two objectives. One objective is to maximize the performance of ELM, which refers to the benefit of the SMONGE model. Another objective is to minimize the output weight norm of ELM, which is related to the cost of the SMONGE model. We compare the SCAE with six state-of-the-art feature extraction methods and compare the SMONGE model with multiple baseline models that contain four classic defect predictors and the MONGE model without SCAE across 20 open source software projects. The experimental results verify that the superiority of SCAE and SMONGE on seven evaluation metrics.",

  abstract  = "Software defect prediction is a research hotspot in the field of software engineering. However, due to the limitations of current machine learning algorithms, we can{\textquoteright}t achieve good effect for defect prediction by only using machine learning algorithms. In previous studies, some researchers used extreme learning machine (ELM) to conduct defect prediction. However, the initial weights and biases of the ELM are determined randomly, which reduces the prediction performance of ELM. Motivated by the idea of search based software engineering, we propose a novel software defect prediction model named KAEA based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), adaptive genetic algorithm, extreme learning machine and Adaboost algorithm, which has three main advantages: (1) KPCA can extract optimal representative features by leveraging a nonlinear mapping function; (2) We leverage adaptive genetic algorithm to optimize the initial weights and biases of ELM, so as to improve the generalization ability and prediction capacity of ELM; (3) We use the Adaboost algorithm to integrate multiple ELM basic predictors optimized by adaptive genetic algorithm into a strong predictor, which can further improve the effect of defect prediction. To effectively evaluate the performance of KAEA, we use eleven datasets from large open source projects, and compare the KAEA with four machine learning basic classifiers, ELM and its three variants. The experimental results show that KAEA is superior to these baseline models in most cases.",

  abstract  = "With the continuous expansion of software scale, software update and maintenance have become more and more important. However, frequent software code updates will make the software more likely to introduce new defects. So how to predict the defects quickly and accurately on the software change has become an important problem for software developers. Current defect prediction methods often cannot reflect the feature information of the defect comprehensively, and the detection effect is not ideal enough. Therefore, we propose a novel defect prediction model named ITNB (Improved Transfer Naive Bayes) based on improved transfer Naive Bayesian algorithm in this paper, which mainly considers the following two aspects: (1) Considering that the edge data of the test set may affect the similarity calculation and final prediction result, we remove the edge data of the test set when calculating the data similarity between the training set and the test set; (2) Considering that each feature dimension has different effects on defect prediction, we construct the calculation formula of training data weight based on feature dimension weight and data gravity, and then calculate the prior probability and the conditional probability of training data from the weight information, so as to construct the weighted bayesian classifier for software defect prediction. To evaluate the performance of the ITNB model, we use six datasets from large open source projects, namely Bugzilla, Columba, Mozilla, JDT, Platform and PostgreSQL. We compare the ITNB model with the transfer Naive Bayesian (TNB) model. The experimental results show that our ITNB model can achieve better results than the TNB model in terms of accurary, precision and pd for within-project and cross-project defect prediction.",

However, when SaaS software is running, it will suffer from performance fault due to factors such as the software structural design or complex environments. It is a major challenge that how to diagnose software quickly and accurately when the performance fault occurs. For this challenge, we propose a novel performance fault diagnosis method for SaaS software based on GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) algorithm. In particular, we leverage the monitoring mean to obtain the performance log and warning log when the SaaS software system runs, and establish the performance fault type set and determine performance log feature. We also perform performance fault type annotation for the performance log combined with the analysis result of the warning log. Moreover, we deal with the incomplete performance log and the type non-equalization problem by using the mean filling for the same type and combination of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and undersampling methods. Finally, we conduct an empirical study combined with the disaster reduction system deployed on the cloud platform, and it demonstrates that the proposed method has high efficiency and accuracy for the performance diagnosis when SaaS software system runs.",
